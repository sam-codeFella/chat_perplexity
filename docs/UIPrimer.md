# Layout.tsx

The `layout.tsx` file is a crucial component in Next.js applications. It serves as the root layout that wraps around all other pages in the application. Below is a detailed breakdown of its structure and functionality.

## Imports and Metadata Setup

- **Imports**: The file imports necessary components and types.
    - `sonner`: A toast notification library.
    - A custom `ThemeProvider` component.
- **Metadata Configuration**:
    - `metadataBase: new URL('https://chat.vercel.ai')`
    - Sets up SEO-related metadata for the application, including the title and description for search results and social shares.

## Viewport Settings

- Prevents auto-zooming on mobile Safari to enhance the mobile user experience.

## Theme Color Management

A sophisticated theme color management system is implemented using JavaScript:

- **Theme Colors**:
    - `LIGHT_THEME_COLOR`: Defines the color for light themes.
    - `DARK_THEME_COLOR`: Defines the color for dark themes.
- **THEME_COLOR_SCRIPT**:
    - A self-executing function that:
        - Manages the `theme-color` meta tag in the document head.
        - Observes changes to the HTML element's class list.
        - Automatically updates the theme color when the theme changes.
    - This affects browser UI elements like the mobile status bar color.

## Root Layout Component

The main layout component wraps all pages in the application:

- **Props**:
    - Takes `children` as a prop, which represents page content.
- **HTML Structure**:
    - Sets up basic HTML structure.
    - Includes the theme color script in the `<head>`.
- **Theme Management**:
    - Implements theme management through `ThemeProvider`.
- **Toast Notifications**:
    - Includes a toast notification system (`Toaster`) for user feedback.

## Theme Implementation

The `ThemeProvider` is configured to:

- Use CSS classes for theme switching.
- Default to the system theme.
- Enable system theme detection.
- Disable transitions during theme changes to prevent visual glitches.

## Toast Notifications

Toast notifications are set up to display messages at the top-center of the screen, improving user feedback mechanisms.
